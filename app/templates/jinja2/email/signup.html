<p>If you do not have an account already, please create an account here: {{ site_url }}{{ url('signup', args=[signup_invite.id]) }}</p>

<p>Below you will find details regarding the weeklong. We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game will begin on </span><strong>Monday March 14th at Midnight </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">runs 24 hours a day until </span><strong>Friday March 18th at 9 PM </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Apologies if you&rsquo;ve already been sent this email in the process of signing up; for those who haven&rsquo;t seen it yet, please read it fully!</span></p>
<p>We understand that there will likely be concerns around player safety, given the nature of gameplay. Below, please find the modifications made to the game in response to COVID-19. </p>
<ul>
     <li><strong>All players MUST be vaccinated.</strong> Following the University of Waterloo’s COVID-19 protocols, all students, staff, alumni and campus visitors MUST submit proof of vaccination prior to entering campus. Please be sure to submit your proof of vaccination here: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/news/submit-your-proof-vaccination-today">https://uwaterloo.ca/coronavirus/news/submit-your-proof-vaccination-today</a>. If you are not a student at UWaterloo, please email us proof of your vaccination status at uwhumansvszombies@gmail.com.</li>
<li><strong>Mandating face masks while playing.</strong> Yes, even when you’re outside. Masks should be covering your nose, mouth, and chin. Bandanas are not acceptable masks. This is in conjunction with our no-face-covering rule, which is still required from us by Campus Police. As such, your face mask should cover your nose, mouth, chin, but not obstruct the upper half of your face.</li>
     <li><strong>Recommending all players to maintain physical distancing as much as possible.</strong> Again, we can’t control what you do. But we ask you to consider physical distancing with other players wherever possible.</li>
     <li><strong>Requiring a COVID-19 self-assessment prior to gameplay.</strong> The first time you sign into the website, you will be greeted with a screen asking you to complete the Ontario COVID-19 self-assessment.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>If you have any signs or symptoms of COVID-19, DO NOT PLAY. </p>
 <p><strong>Please also note that there are some changes in rules from our typical weeklong. These changes are listed below:</strong></p>
 <ul>
     <li>Buildings are once again safe from 10AM-4PM. <b>Bridges and tunnels are <i>not</i> safe zones!</b></li>
     <li>Removal of the infected human mechanic.</li>
     <li>As per a typical weeklong, unsupplied humans <b>will</b> be killed off on Friday before the final mission.</li>
     <li>Rail and building passes are reinstated as potential point rewards.</li>
 </ul>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any signs or symptoms of COVID-19, DO NOT PLAY. </span><strong>DO NOT PLAY. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">We understand how much fun HvZ can be, and can empathize with anyone who has waited a long time to play again. We promise there will be more HvZ games this term and in the future. </span><strong>HOWEVER</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we can only make good on that promise if </span><strong>EVERYONE TAKES THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS SERIOUSLY.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Please don&rsquo;t risk cancelling the game permanently for literally everyone else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure to read and agree to the waiver, as well as read the </span><a href="https://uwhvz.uwaterloo.ca/static/files/hvz-rules-v1.4.pdf"><strong>RULES</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this term.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">understand that they are long, but we promise it&rsquo;ll be worth it! We&rsquo;ve got quite an event planned out, and it will be even better if all players follow our rules. As well, a guide written specifically for new players is accessible</span><a href="http://uwhvz.uwaterloo.ca/static/files/Weeklong%20101%20%26%20FAQs%20v1.0.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><strong>11:00 PM on Sunday March 13th</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you will receive an email indicating whether you are beginning the game as a HUMAN or a ZOMBIE. If you would like to be considered as a zombie, and did not check the corresponding box on sign-up, please email </span><strong>uwhumansvszombies@gmail.com</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This email will also include information relevant for the entire weeklong, so make sure you&rsquo;re checking your inbox! Make sure to check your spam folder as well if you haven&rsquo;t received any emails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the week, the moderator team will be communicating to you primarily through email. Each night, an email will be sent out including the schedule and events for the next day. Main Mission details will be sent out in a separate email one hour before the Main Mission begins - there will be at least one occurring each day. Our website (</span><a href="http://uwhvz.uwaterloo.ca/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uwhvz.uwaterloo.ca</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) will also display announcements and mission details for the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional important information will also be sent over twitter through</span><a href="https://twitter.com/hvzalertsystem"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">@HVZAlertSystem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to rent a blaster from the Humans vs Zombie Society for use in the weeklong, you can email us at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uwhumansvszombies@gmail.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please also consider joining our</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/uwhvz/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to easily access updates relating to the other events during the term.&nbsp;</span></p>
